Texture is Optional, but Strongly recommend. There are two texture packs for this mod. One changes some redstone componets' apperence similar to Wacth Dog 2. One allows you see actual redstone power.

## About

Hi, everyone! This is Extra Redstone Craft Mod. A mod adding more decoration, redstone and useful utilities. 

All the item added in this mod has been fully considered. This mod does not change vanilla game experiences . It is more likely a addon for Minecraft vanilla. We love this game, and we want to make it better. Redstone components are quite boring in Minecraft vanilla for many year. All we have are piston, slime blocks, redstone  wire. They are good, but tedious.

Create Mod is really good mod. Crafting without GUI, is one of our goal to make game simple. Minecraft really need to change interact mode. We are a little bit tired of old redstone components and old restone gate blocks. We want redstone automate any thing. We surely need a new energy to power those components. That's our goal, to recreate and rebuild a better Minecraft.

This mod is ready to add more content in the future, we will learn form other games, and other mod creators.
